- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EvanSeven007

Currently balancing pursuing my computer science degree and trying to learn as much as I can about web3 development

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ETH, NFTs, Smart Contracts, and ML
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Solidity, Node.js, ML

Projects I am currently working on: 
EvansStutterBot - a bot that will hopefully be able to both detect and correct for stuttering given any audio input
PiggyBank - a web app powered by a smart contract that allows users to store ETH for a specified amount of time
