- 👋 Hi, I’m @EvanSeven007

Currently balancing pursuing my computer science degree and trying to learn as much as I can about web3 development

- 👀 I’m interested in ETH, NFTs, Smart Contracts, and ML
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity, Node.js, ML

Projects I am currently working on: 
EvansStutterBot - a bot that will hopefully be able to both detect and correct for stuttering given any audio input of anyone speaking
